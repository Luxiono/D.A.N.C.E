# D.A.N.C.E
An upcoming project to recreate DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) for PCs.

While other DDR projects (such as Etterna) exist, this one is meant to be *hopefully* more 'complete' than that, with easy song downloading, built-in updaters, and heavily improved graphics.

I have not yet decided if the game will be entirely made in C# or if it will be made in Unity, but here's what I know about it:

## C# (C-Sharp)
=> General basics, such as classes, variable setting, bare stuff needed for C#

=> Kinda it, actually

## Unity (Game Engine + C#)
=> How the engine works

=> How to place and create simple items, like buttons

I want to know which one you think would be best for me. I'll put an issue up soon to let you vote.

However, I may choose C# just because I'll only need to learn the language, not anything related to an engine.

Early prototypes *might* come in early 2020.

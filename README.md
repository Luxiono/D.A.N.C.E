# D.A.N.C.E
An upcoming project to recreate DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) for PCs.

While other DDR projects (such as Etterna) exist, this one is meant to be *hopefully* more 'complete' than that, with direct song downloading, built-in updaters, and heavily improved graphics.

The game will be developed in standalone C# using Visual Studio, similar to the game [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu).

## Licensing
The game is built under the MIT License, which gives general copyright protection to this repository and also allows for open-sourcing and other repositories to use the base code for the game. More information can be found on the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/Luxiono/D.A.N.C.E/blob/master/LICENSE).

# D.A.N.C.E
An upcoming project to recreate DDR (Dance Dance Revolution) for PCs.

While other DDR projects (such as Etterna) exist, this one is meant to be *hopefully* more 'complete' than that, with easy song downloading, built-in updaters, and heavily improved graphics.

Due to my current lack of skill in C# programming, this may not exist for a while, but hopefully in 2020, very unpolished prototypes may be posted.
